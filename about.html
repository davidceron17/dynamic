        <p>I am John David Ceron, a passionate and creative individual who loves to build and create things from scratch. My
        interest in programming started when I was a teenager, and I've been hooked ever since. I am a self-taught developer,
        and I love learning new things every day.
        <br>
        My experience includes developing websites, web applications, and mobile applications. I specialize in front-end
        development, and I have experience working with popular web development frameworks such as React and Angular.
        <br>
        Aside from coding, I also enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I love hiking and exploring new places, and
        I'm always up for a good adventure. I believe that life is all about discovering new things and challenging oneself,
        both in personal and professional aspects.
        <br>
        One of my favorite things about being a developer is the ability to solve problems and create innovative solutions. I
        believe that technology can help make the world a better place, and I am always excited to be a part of that change.
        <br>
        I am constantly looking for new ways to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. Whether
        it's attending conferences or reading books, I believe that learning is a lifelong process.
        <br>
        I am excited to continue my journey as a developer and to see where it takes me. If you have any questions or would like
        to work together, feel free to reach out to me.</p>
